    "Prompt: Fluent is a performance-based customer acquisition platform that is able to drive quality and volume to clients. While the company excels at customer acquisition, it must improve at selling merchandise. Users that are most likely to buy merchandise (Cost Per Action or CPA Wall buyer) are valuable because there is theoretically limitless upside. The way our merchandise program works now, a broker pays us per sale that originated from our website and we can continue to scale as long as the broker's return on investment remains positive. In addition, users who buy one item on the CPA Wall tend to be our most profitable users."

    "* Hypothesis: The user most likely to buy on the CPA Wall will be a female greater than 45 years old. Age will have the most impact on whether a user is a CPA Wall buyer since an older person typically tends to have more disposable income and so is better able to spend. Female users subscribe to offers more often than male users across most of Fluent's sites, so there could be a similar association on the CPA Wall between females and a propensity to spend. At this moment I think a random forest model will work best with the data, but as always, \"There is no free lunch.\""

Being able to classify a user in real time can give us a real time expected value for that user, thus better allowing us to maximize revenue per registration."
